          <ul>
            <li>2/3 tbs fine salt</li>
            <li>2 cups (300g) plain flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon dried thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 tbs dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbs celery salt</li>
            <li>1/3 tbs dried oregano leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbs ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbs garlic salt</li>
            <li>4 tbs paprika</li>
            <li>1 tbs ground ginger</li>
            <li>3 tbs ground white pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup (250ml) buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Canola oil, to deep-fry</li>

          <h2>Recipe</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mix the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices the set
              aside
            </li>
            <li>Beat the eggs untill fully mixed</li>
            <li>
              Mix the buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl until
              combined. Soak the chicken in the buttermilk mixture at room
              temperature for 20-30 minutes.
              <li>Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the chicken pieces in the herb-spice-flour mixture to coat all sides, shaking off excess. Allow to sit on a rack over a baking tray for 20 minutes.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat 7-8cm canola oil in a large casserole or similar heavy-based pan with high sides over medium-high heat to 180°C. (Use a deep-frying thermometer to check the temperature.) When temperature is reached, lower the heat to medium to maintain the oil at 180°C. Fry 3 or 4 pieces of chicken at a time, being careful not to crowd the pan. Fry for 15-18 minutes, turning once, until medium golden brown. Transfer chicken pieces to a baking tray lined with paper towel. Allow the oil to return to 180°C each time before adding more chicken. Repeat with remaining chicken, then serve.</li>
